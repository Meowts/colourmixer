##Colours!

Have fun mixing colours! This is based on the theory of creating a harmonized colour palette using opacity-70 : opacity-30 between two base colours, but you can adjust the ratio if you so desire.

##How to start using it

Just pull/download this repos and open up colours.html in your favourite browser. That's it, no server required, just an AngularJS app that runs from your filesystem.

It should be pretty clear what to do from there - you can edit the base colours and opacity ratio and it will update what's being output.
