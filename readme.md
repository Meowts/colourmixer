##Colours!

Have fun mixing colours to create a pretty colour palette!

##How to start using it

Just pull/download this repos and open up colours.html in your favourite browser. That's it, no server required, just an AngularJS app that runs from your filesystem.

It should be pretty clear what to do from there - you can edit the base colours and it will update what's being output.
